      "EN" : "In Burkina Faso very little is known about levels of vitamin A, iron, and zinc deficiencies. The lack of detailed knowledge about food and nutrients intake and deficiency levels is a substantial obstacle to the design, implementation and evaluation of effective food-based interventions such as biofortification. The present study, a preliminary study of a sorghum biofortification project, was conducted to contribute to fill that knowledge gap in two rural provinces of Burkina Faso.\n\nIts objectives were: (i) to provide reliable information on sorghum consumption, micronutrient intakes and micronutrient deficiencies among women of reproductive age and their preschool children, in order to better inform sorghum micronutrient content breeding targets and future interventions; and (ii) to investigate the relationship between biomarkers of status and dietary intakes of iron, zinc and vitamin A among the study subjects in order to better inform the evaluation design of future biofortification interventions.\n\nThis work is part of the Grand Challenges in Global Health (#9), an initiative of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through a grant to the International Food Policy Research Institute; with additional funds from the Institut de Recherche pour le Développement."

From these usual intakes for each nutrient, the probability of adequacy (PA) of the intake was calculated using the EAR and their distribution in the population (see Table 2). As this approach can only be applied to nutrients with a symmetric distribution, the PA for iron was calculated using values given in Table A 7 which were adapted from IOM (2000) to give PA for various levels of iron intakes for two different levels of bioavailability. Considering the dietary pattern encountered in Burkina Faso, the lowest bioavailability was assumed for iron and zinc. Usual intakes and PA were calculated using an adaptation of the STATA syntax developed for the needs of the Women’s Dietary Diversity Project (WDDP) further developed in Arimond et al., 2008."

          "EN" : "The survey was cross-sectional and targeted women and preschool children in two rural provinces in western and north-western Burkina Faso: the Sanguié province, in the Region of the Centre-Ouest; and the Sourou province, in the Region of the Boucle du Mouhoun. The target population consisted of women and preschool children because of their high micronutrient requirements due to their needs for reproduction and growth, respectively. Children aged 36–59 months were selected because at this age they were consuming family dishes, were unlikely to be breastfed, and were more likely to benefit from biofortification due to greater intake of sorghum than younger children. Mothers were recruited along with their children for convenience. One index child from the target age range was randomly selected from a household. The sampling procedure was a multistage cluster selection process of 240 households in each province (five health areas per province × six clusters per area × eight households per cluster). At the first stage, the health areas were randomly selected proportionally to their population size. Population sizes in health areas and villages were obtained from medical districts' records and were further checked for consistency by comparison of the data available from the National Census of 2006. At the next stage, six clusters (villages) were selected in each health area through the same proportional to size technique. Eligible households were identified in each village through a census of all households. Eligible households were those living permanently in the village and having a mother of a child aged 36–59 months who agreed to participate in the study. Among eligible households, the desirable number of households was then selected for the survey using a random number digits table. Out of 480 households having eligible woman & child pair that were selected for data collection, 478 actually took part in the survey. After analysis of food intakes, over- or under-reporters were excluded (24 women and 32 children). Out of 180 child-mother pairs selected for blood puncture, 166 women and 155 children were actually sampled. Sampling weights for each province were created."
